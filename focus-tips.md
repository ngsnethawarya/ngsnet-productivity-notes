# Productivity Focus Tips

These are simple, practical productivity tips that help me stay consistent, organized, and focused—especially while learning cybersecurity and working on technical projects.

---

## 1. Document Everything
Writing things down helps me avoid repeating the same mistakes. I save troubleshooting steps, commands, and ideas so I can re-use them later.

---

## 2. Use Time Blocks
Working in focused 25–30 minute sessions improves my concentration. Short, intense work > long, unfocused work.

---

## 3. Keep Things Simple
Small daily progress is better than trying to do everything at once. I keep my tasks clear, small, and achievable.

---

## 4. Keep Digital Files Organized
A clean folder structure makes projects easier to work on. I use meaningful names and separate projects properly.

---

## 5. Make One Improvement Each Day
Learning one new command, concept, or technique every day builds long-term skill without burnout.
